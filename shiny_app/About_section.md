## About 
This project was written in order to analyze a list of genes of interest. To better understand the biological functions of these genes, several types of classifications and enrichments are carried out. Gene enrichments,  pathway enrichments  are thus proposed.
Two types of gene lists are supported, ordered lists and unordered lists.
