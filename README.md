# ShinY-GL - Shiny Your Gene List

An R-Shiny application for the downstream analysis of gene list of interest

#### Developed by [Corali Capron](https://github.com/Browco) and [Costas Bouyioukos](https://github.com/cbouyio)

_________

A simple to use R-Shiny application for the downstream gene enrichment and pathway analysis any gene list of interest.

The application takes a simple **un-ordered** gene list, or a gene list **ordered** by any arbritary criterion of interest (expression log-Fold-Change, enrichment in peaks, as so on) and performs the following analyses:

1. Gene Ontologies enrichment
2. Gene Set enrichments (in case an ordered list is provided)
3. REACTOME pathway enrichment
4. KEGG pathway enrichment

The application creates the relative visulasation of each analysis interms of dotplots and/or barplots.
